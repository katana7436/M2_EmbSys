# Requirements

## Introduction
The purpose of the project is to build a basic calculator based on Atmega328 microcontroller. This simple calculator which can perform Signed operations on 64bits numbers with max of two different math symbols or any number of operands but with the same math symbol. It uses 4×4 matrix keyboard as input device with a 74C922 decoder. This decoder generates an interrupt through External Interrupt INT0 every time a key is pressed. The result of calculation displayed on 16×2 LCD.

An LCD module can be interfaced with a microcontroller either in 8 bit mode or in 4 bit mode. 8 bit mode is the conventional mode which uses 8 data lines and RS, R/W, E pins for functioning. However 4 bit mode uses only 4 data lines along with the control pins. This will saves the number of GPIO pins needed for other purpose.

### Cost and Feature
The cost of the hardware and software design is fixed and one-time investment only.

A calculator is a device that performs numerical operations. The features of this basic calculator can perform:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

## SWOT Analysis

### Strength
* The ultimate strength of calculators is its innovative and user-friendly.
* Calculators are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of basic numerical operations.

### Weaknesses
* The storage capacity is low to store the previous operations.
* Always power supply is needed for the calculator to perform an operation.

### Opportunities
* We can use a solar panel in calculators to reduce the power supply usage.

### Threats
* Nowadays people are not intrested in buying electronic calculator becuase calculator operations are implemented in our portable accessories like smartphones and laptops etc.


## 4W's and 1H

### Why
To perform the basic numerical operations.
To reduce the manpower.
### Where
The calculator can be operated from anywhere.
### Who
Can be used by anyone for numerical operation
### When
Anyone who have to solve a basic calculation.
### How
Giving different inputs we can find their desired output.
